# Sales Project
In this portion of the project, I demonstrated the distributions of the sub-category sales using different charts. I then created a linear regression model and conducted a hypothesis test on the significance of the coefficients.
The rest of the project is done on PostgreSQL for the manipaulation of the data and on Power BI for the visualizations.
