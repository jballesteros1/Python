## Sales Project
In this portion of the project, I demonstrated the distributions of the sub-category sales using different charts. I then created a linear regression model and conducted a hypothesis test on the significance of the coefficients.
The rest of the project is done on PostgreSQL for the manipaulation of the data and on Power BI for the visualizations.

## Medicare Inpatient Project
This project deals with discovering the top inpatient discharge-related groups(DRG) for Medicare Type A beneficiaries in the state of Texas. For majority of this project, I conducted analysis in PostresSQL and Power BI. However, in the file in this repository, I used Python to parse the number ids from the from the entire DRG Defintion column. The 35 id numbers shown seperated by pipe keys are the most common in the state of Texas for the years 2014 and 2018 combined which were retrieved in psql. 


## STB Exchanges
This project has been conducted to improve efficiency to the STB Exchange team. Exchanges Cleaned wrangles with the data on Shipped & Received file to concise any descrepancies using Python and Jupyter Notebook. There are 5 files that were completed using SQL language that demonstrate the merging of the modified Shipped & Received file with the  Sharepoint Exchanges file. Also used in the merging were the files produced from the STB Project where we invoiced sites that had owed us from exchanges. This data was used on the visualizations presented on Power BI.
