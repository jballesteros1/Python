# Sales Project
### In this portion of the project, I demonstrated the distributions of the sub-category sales using different charts. I also conducted a hypthesis on the coefficients of the regression model to check the significance of the coefficients.
The rest of the project is done on PostgresSQL for the manipaulation of the data and on Power Bi for the visualizations.
