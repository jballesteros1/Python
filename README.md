## Sales Project
In this portion of the project, I demonstrated the distributions of the sub-category sales using different charts. I then created a linear regression model and conducted a hypothesis test on the significance of the coefficients.
The rest of the project is done on PostgreSQL for the manipaulation of the data and on Power BI for the visualizations.

## Medicare Inpatient Project
This project deals with discovering the top discharge-related groups in the state of Texas for two years. Majority of this project, I conducted analysis in PostresSQL and Power BI. However, in the file in this reppository, I parsed the number id from the from the entire DRG Defintion column. The 35 id numbers are the most common in the state of Texas for the years 2014 and 2018 combined which were retrieved in psql.
